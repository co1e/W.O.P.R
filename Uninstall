There isn’t a one-command uninstaller yet, but you can remove everything manually:

1.	Delete launcher scripts

rm -f ~/.local/share/steam-launcher/enter-gamesmode
rm -f ~/.local/share/steam-launcher/leave-gamesmode
rmdir ~/.local/share/steam-launcher 2>/dev/null || true

	2.	Remove Hyprland bindings

Edit your bindings config (~/.config/hypr/bindings.conf or similar) and delete the block between:

# Gaming Mode bindings - added by installation script
...
# End Gaming Mode bindings

3.    Remove config and state (optional)

rm -f ~/.gaming-mode.conf
rm -rf ~/.cache/gaming-session

4.	Remove udev rules (optional)

sudo rm -f /etc/udev/rules.d/99-gaming-performance.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload

	5.	Remove Intel Arc GTK fix (if you enabled it)
  Delete the created environment file under /etc/environment.d/ or ~/.config/environment.d/ and log out/in.
