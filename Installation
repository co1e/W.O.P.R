	During the first run the installer will:

1.	Validate environment

	•	Verifies pacman, hyprctl and a Hypr config are present.

2.	Refresh and optionally upgrade the system

	•	Runs pacman -Syy
	•	Optionally runs pacman -Syu (you can skip, but may hit dependency issues later).

3.	Check and install dependencies

	•	Steam and its 32-bit libraries
	•	Gamescope
	•	MangoHud
	•	GameMode
	•	gum
	•	GPU-specific Vulkan drivers and supporting libs

4.	Ensure multilib is enabled

	•	Warns you and offers to add [multilib] to /etc/pacman.conf if needed.

5.	Set up performance permissions (optional)

	•	Creates /etc/udev/rules.d/99-gaming-performance.rules
	•	Allows your user to change CPU governors and certain GPU performance knobs without typing your password each time.

6.	Create launcher scripts

	•	~/.local/share/steam-launcher/enter-gamesmode
	•	~/.local/share/steam-launcher/leave-gamesmode

7.	Add Hyprland bindings and window rules

	•	Appends a block to your bindings config:

# Gaming Mode bindings - added by installation script
windowrulev2 = float, class:(YOUR_TERMINAL_CLASS)
windowrulev2 = size 800 600, class:(YOUR_TERMINAL_CLASS)
windowrulev2 = center, class:(YOUR_TERMINAL_CLASS)
windowrulev2 = pin, class:(YOUR_TERMINAL_CLASS)

# bindd style if you use bindd:
bindd = SUPER SHIFT, S, Steam Gaming Mode, exec, YOUR_TERMINAL_CMD ~/.local/share/steam-launcher/enter-gamesmode
bindd = SUPER SHIFT, R, Exit Gaming Mode, exec, ~/.local/share/steam-launcher/leave-gamesmode

# or plain bind = ... if your config uses that
# End Gaming Mode bindings

8.	Intel Arc option (if applicable)

	•	If an Intel Arc GPU is detected, offers to add a GTK4 environment file under /etc/environment.d/ or ~/.config/environment.d/ that forces GSK_RENDERER=gl.

If you are asked to log out / reboot (e.g. after udev or environment changes), do that once the script finishes.
