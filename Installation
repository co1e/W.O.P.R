The installer will:
	1.	Check your environment
	2.	Offer a system upgrade (recommended)
	3.	Install missing packages
	4.	Deploy enter-gamesmode / leave-gamesmode
	5.	Add Hyprland keybinds and window rules

At the end it will tell you if you need to log out and back in
(e.g. because your user was added to new groups).
