Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to W.O.P.R. 👋
This repository uses a strict protected-branch workflow to ensure that code cannot change without explicit review and approval.

Contribution Rules
	•	All changes must be submitted via a pull request (PR).
	•	The main branch is protected — no one can push to it directly.
	•	All PRs require approval from the project maintainer before they can be merged.
	•	At this time, the only maintainer with merge permissions is Gavin Nugent.
	•	Contributors should fork the repository before making any changes.

This ensures the project remains stable and all modifications are reviewed before entering the codebase.

Ways to Help
	•	Report bugs (screenshots or logs preferred)
	•	Improve documentation or spelling/grammar
	•	Suggest support for additional hardware or compositors
	•	Propose code cleanups or refactors

How to Submit a Pull Request
	1.	Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
	2.	Create a feature branch in your fork.
	3.	Make your changes in small, focused commits.
	4.	If your change affects behaviour, update README.md or relevant docs.
	5.	Open a pull request against the main branch of this repository.
	6.	Wait for review. Only approved PRs will be merged.

Style Guidelines
	•	Target: POSIX-ish bash, using set -Euo pipefail
	•	Code should be readable and defensive
	•	Prefer explicit error messages over hidden magic
	•	Use UK English in user-facing text

Code of Conduct

Be kind, respectful, and constructive. Remember there’s a human on the other side of every issue or pull request.
