Enter Gaming Mode

Once installed and after re-logging in if requested:
	1.	Press SUPER+SHIFT+S.
	2.	A themed TUI will appear.

1. Previous settings prompt
If you have launched gaming mode before, you’ll see:
	•	“Previous settings found. Use previous settings?”
	•	Yes – reuse saved resolution and MangoHud options
	•	No – go through the wizards again

2. Resolution selector
You’ll be shown your current display (e.g. 3840×2160 @ 60Hz) and:
	•	Native resolution (best quality)
	•	1440p upscaled from 1080p (more FPS)
	•	Native 1440p
	•	1440p → 4K upscaled (balanced)
	•	Native 4K/UHD

These correspond to different Gamescope render/output combinations.

3. MangoHud overlay
Choose one of:
	•	Off – no overlay
	•	Minimal – FPS only, recommended
	•	Full Stats – detailed CPU/GPU metrics, frametime graph, temps, etc.

4. Launch screen
A final “Launching Gaming Mode” screen summarises:
	•	Chosen render resolution
	•	Output resolution
	•	Refresh rate
	•	MangoHud preset

The script then:
	•	Exports the correct MANGOHUD_CONFIG (if enabled)
	•	Runs gamemoderun gamescope ... -- steam <args>
	•	Stores the Gamescope PID under ~/.cache/gaming-session/session.pid

By default Steam is launched in Big Picture/tenfoot mode.

Exit Gaming Mode

When you’re done:
	•	Press SUPER+SHIFT+R.

This runs leave-gamesmode, which:
	•	Finds and cleanly kills the running Gamescope session created by W.O.P.R.
	•	Restores:
	•	CPU governors
	•	GPU performance / power settings (where possible)
	•	Any idle/lock tweaks created for the session
	•	Removes the session lock files in ~/.cache/gaming-session/.

If Gamescope failed to start or exits early, the cleanup routines still run to return your system to its previous state.
